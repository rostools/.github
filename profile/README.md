> rostools: Teaching reproducible and open science tools

This GitHub organization contains (mainly) open educational resources
for workshops that teach what reproducible and open science is, why it's
important, and how to use specific tools to do it.

The material uses a fairly opinionated approach to doing reproducible
and open science. Why opinionated? Because it's easier to learn and get
effective in something when there is a clear path to follow.

Some workshops are:

-   [r-cubed-intro.rostools.org](https://r-cubed-intro.rostools.org)
-   [r-cubed-intermediate.rostools.org](https://r-cubed-intermediate.rostools.org)
-   [r-cubed-advanced.rostools.org](https://r-cubed-advanced.rostools.org)
-   [github-intro.rostools.org](https://github-intro.rostools.org)

Resources and helper repos:

-   [Guides](https://guides.rostools.org/): Guides for teachers,
    helpers, admin, as well as common instructions for participants.
-   [`r3`](https://github.com/rostools/r3/): A helper R package for
    setting up participants computers, running checks, and installing
    necessary packages for the R-based workshops.
-   [`template-workshop`](https://template-workshop.rostools.org):
    An opinionated setup for making workshops as open educational resources.
-   [`samwise`](https://github.com/rostools/samwise/): A helper R
    package for doing admin tasks for all workshops, such as getting the
    workshop feedback and checking participant sign-up and pre- workshop
    task completion.
