> rostools: Teaching reproducible and open science tools

This GitHub organization contains (mainly) open educational resources for workshops
that teach what reproducible and open science is, why it's important, and how to use specific
tools to do it.

The material uses a fairly opinionated approach to doing reproducible and open science.
Why opinionated? Because it's easier to learn and get effective in something when there
is a clear path to follow.

Some workshops are:

- [r-cubed-intermediate.rostools.org](https://r-cubed-intermediate.rostools.org)
- [r-cubed-advanced.rostools.org](https://r-cubed-advanced.rostools.org)
